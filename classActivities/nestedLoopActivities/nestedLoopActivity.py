# 1. using randint, create a range from 1-20 and store it to a variable. use that range to create a list starting with 1 and ending with the last value in the range that was selected. create another list with elements ["red", "blue", "yellow"]. do a nested for loop on both list and print out the values



# 2. using the two lists below, create a nested loop using a while loop and a for loop to print out both elements of the list
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = ["blue", "green", "red"]
